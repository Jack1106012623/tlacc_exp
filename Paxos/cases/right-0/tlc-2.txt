Computing initial states...
Finished computing initial states: 1 distinct state generated at 2024-03-22 13:49:11.
Progress(11) at 2024-03-22 13:49:14: 46,109 states generated (46,109 s/min), 10,670 distinct states found (10,670 ds/min), 5,166 states left on queue.
Progress(19) at 2024-03-22 13:50:14: 1,056,340 states generated (1,010,231 s/min), 157,426 distinct states found (146,756 ds/min), 21,144 states left on queue.
Model checking completed. No error has been found.
  Estimates of the probability that TLC did not check all reachable states
  because two distinct states had the same fingerprint:
  calculated (optimistic):  val = 1.2E-8
  based on the actual fingerprints:  val = 9.3E-10
1382794 states generated, 185369 distinct states found, 0 states left on queue.
The depth of the complete state graph search is 25.
The average outdegree of the complete state graph is 1 (minimum is 0, the maximum 9 and the 95th percentile is 3).
