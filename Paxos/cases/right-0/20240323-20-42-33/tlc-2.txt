Computing initial states...
Finished computing initial states: 1 distinct state generated at 2024-03-23 20:43:14.
Progress(12) at 2024-03-23 20:43:17: 76,199 states generated (76,199 s/min), 16,849 distinct states found (16,849 ds/min), 7,818 states left on queue.
Model checking completed. No error has been found.
  Estimates of the probability that TLC did not check all reachable states
  because two distinct states had the same fingerprint:
  calculated (optimistic):  val = 1.2E-8
  based on the actual fingerprints:  val = 3.0E-9
1382794 states generated, 185369 distinct states found, 0 states left on queue.
The depth of the complete state graph search is 25.
The average outdegree of the complete state graph is 1 (minimum is 0, the maximum 9 and the 95th percentile is 3).
