Computing initial states...
Finished computing initial states: 1 distinct state generated at 2024-03-23 20:44:57.
Progress(11) at 2024-03-23 20:45:00: 49,390 states generated (49,390 s/min), 12,125 distinct states found (12,125 ds/min), 6,435 states left on queue.
Progress(18) at 2024-03-23 20:46:00: 1,654,399 states generated (1,605,009 s/min), 256,674 distinct states found (244,549 ds/min), 52,517 states left on queue.
Model checking completed. No error has been found.
  Estimates of the probability that TLC did not check all reachable states
  because two distinct states had the same fingerprint:
  calculated (optimistic):  val = 4.7E-8
  based on the actual fingerprints:  val = 1.0E-8
2743879 states generated, 362361 distinct states found, 0 states left on queue.
The depth of the complete state graph search is 25.
The average outdegree of the complete state graph is 1 (minimum is 0, the maximum 9 and the 95th percentile is 3).
